    <h1>What is Github?</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an
      intricate platform that fosters collaboration and communication between
      developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development
      teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions
      of software without disrupting the current versions, but it doesn’t stop
      there.
    </p>
    <h1>How to use GitHub?</h1>
    <h3>1. Sign up for GitHub</h3>
    <p>
      In order to use GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub account. You can create a
      free GitHub account here and start using GitHub right away. With a free
      account, you’ll get access to unlimited public and private repositories.
      You’ll also get bug tracking and project management features. The only
      downside is that you’ll only be allowed three collaborators for private
      repositories. If you’re still in the “GitHub for beginners” stage, signing
      up for a free account is a great place to start.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Install Git</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub runs on Git. What is Git? Git is a version-control system created
      by programming icon, Linus Torvald. He originally created Git to track
      changes to source code changes as he was developing the Linux operating
      system. Git helps programmers collaborate, coordinate work, and work
      together on complex code and development projects. Git tracks changes and
      helps teams work remotely on intricate programs. Click here to install Git
      on your computer. Some prefer to make changes using the command line in
      Git itself. For our purposes, though, we’ll focus on how to do things
      within GitHub.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Create a Repository</h3>
    <p>
      To do anything in GitHub, you’ll need to know how to first start a
      repository. A repository (or repo) is essentially synonymous with the word
      “project.” Quite simply, a repository stores everything pertinent to a
      specific project including files, images, spreadsheets, data sets, and
      videos, often sorted into files. It’s best to include a README file within
      your repository that has specific information regarding the given project.
      On GitHub, you can add a README file right when you create a new
      repository. To create a new repository, you’ll hit “new repository” in the
      upper-right-hand corner. You can then name your repository, include a
      brief description, and check the box that says “initialize this repository
      with a README.” Finally, you’ll click “create repository.”
    </p>
    <h3>4. Create a branch</h3>
    <p>
      Projects are multi-faceted and many program versions are required when
      you’re building. Branching enables you to edit multiple unique versions of
      a repository at once. Your repository automatically has a definitive
      branch called master. You can work on several different branches in order
      to make edits before eventually committing them to the master branch.
      <br />

      When a new branch is started, it’ll be a copy of the master branch until
      you edit it to make new changes. A branch typically goes through many
      steps and approvals before it is ever merged into the master branch. To
      start a new branch in GitHub, navigate to your new repository, click the
      dropdown that reads “branch: master,” type a branch name (like
      README-edits), and then hit “create branch.” Branches are ideal for new
      features or bug fixes.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Create and commit changes to a branch</h3>
    <p>
      To make changes to a branch in GitHub, go to the code view for your newly
      created branch. Click the file you want to change, then hit the pencil
      icon in the upper right, make any necessary edits, describe your changes
      by writing a commit message, and then click “commit changes.” Each saved
      change is called a commit. Every individual commit has its own commit
      message which gives more details into why a specific change was done. The
      commit messages give a history of changes and help project contributors
      understand how the project has changed over time.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Open a pull request</h3>
    <p>
      In order for any branch to be merged into another person’s branch, you
      must open a pull request. A pull request is GitHub’s way of notifying
      relevant parties about your request to incorporate changes into their
      branch. A pull request will show in red and green the differences of the
      content between branches. You can make a pull request any time you
      complete a commit. For best results, when sending a pull request, you can
      use the “@” feature to mention specific people from whom you need
      feedback. <br />

      To open a pull request, you’ll go to the “pull request” tab and hit the
      button that says “new pull request.” Next, in the “example comparisons”
      box, find the branch you made and compare it with the master. Ensure you
      like the changes and then click the “create pull request” button. Title
      your pull request and briefly describe the changes. To finish, click
      “create pull request.”
    </p>
    <h3>7. Merge your pull request</h3>
    <p>
      Merging your pull request with the master branch is something you may need
      to pass on to your superiors to handle. For the sake of learning, though,
      you can practice doing it yourself. Simply hit the button that says “merge
      pull request,” select “confirm merge,” and then delete the branch you
      merged once it has been incorporated into the master.
