    <h1>What is Github</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an
      intricate platform that fosters collaboration and communication between
      developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development
      teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions
      of software without disrupting the current versions, but it doesn’t stop
      there.

    <h1>How to use GitHub</h1>
    <p>
      1. Sign up for GitHub In order to use GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub
      account. You can create a free GitHub account here and start using GitHub
      right away. With a free account, you’ll get access to unlimited public and
      private repositories. You’ll also get bug tracking and project management
      features. The only downside is that you’ll only be allowed three
      collaborators for private repositories. If you’re still in the “GitHub for
      beginners” stage, signing up for a free account is a great place to start.
