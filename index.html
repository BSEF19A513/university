    <h1>What is Github?</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an
      intricate platform that fosters collaboration and communication between
      developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development
      teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions
      of software without disrupting the current versions, but it doesn’t stop
      there.

    <h1>How to use GitHub?</h1>
    <h3> 1. Sign up for GitHub </h3>
    <p>
      In order to use GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub account. You can create a
      free GitHub account here and start using GitHub right away. With a free
      account, you’ll get access to unlimited public and private repositories.
      You’ll also get bug tracking and project management features. The only
      downside is that you’ll only be allowed three collaborators for private
      repositories. If you’re still in the “GitHub for beginners” stage, signing
      up for a free account is a great place to start.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Install Git</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub runs on Git. What is Git? Git is a version-control system created
      by programming icon, Linus Torvald. He originally created Git to track
      changes to source code changes as he was developing the Linux operating
      system. Git helps programmers collaborate, coordinate work, and work
      together on complex code and development projects. Git tracks changes and
      helps teams work remotely on intricate programs. Click here to install Git
      on your computer. Some prefer to make changes using the command line in
      Git itself. For our purposes, though, we’ll focus on how to do things
      within GitHub.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Create a Repository</h3>
    <p>
      To do anything in GitHub, you’ll need to know how to first start a
      repository. A repository (or repo) is essentially synonymous with the word
      “project.” Quite simply, a repository stores everything pertinent to a
      specific project including files, images, spreadsheets, data sets, and
      videos, often sorted into files. It’s best to include a README file within
      your repository that has specific information regarding the given project.
      On GitHub, you can add a README file right when you create a new
      repository. To create a new repository, you’ll hit “new repository” in the
      upper-right-hand corner. You can then name your repository, include a
      brief description, and check the box that says “initialize this repository
      with a README.” Finally, you’ll click “create repository.”
